# CSS

-   **Cascading Style Sheet**

    -   A language for styling HTML documents.
    -   It specifies certain rules for layout and display of HTML elements.
    -   **uses key/value pairs** to indicate the styling to apply.
    -   Style Sheets are a **simple but powerful** way of changing how our HTML document is rendered to make it more pleasant to look at.
    -   CSS is broken down into selectors and declarations
    -   **Selector**
        -   Defines the element(s) you are styling.
    -   **Declaration**
        -   Defines the style you are imposing on the selector.

## CSS Box Model (post pic before typing out the use of each layer)

![CSS Box Model](https://miro.medium.com/max/408/1*sKnLrT1TtqWDZg7GWoBCow.png)

-   CSS treats each HTML element in the document as a “box” Each box has its own 4 regions all that can be styled independently of each other.
-   From outer to inner the regions are:
    -   **Margin**
        -   The outermost layer.
        -   Useful for separating the element from its neighbors.
        -   The dimensions are given by the margin-box width and the margin-box height.
    -   **Border**
        -   The layer between the box’s padding and margin.
        -   Its dimensions are given by the width and height of the border.
    -   **Padding**
        -   The layer around the content area and within the border-box.
        -   Its dimensions are given by the width and height of the padding-box.
    -   **Content**
        -   It consists of content like text, image, or other media content.
        -   It is bounded by the content edge
        -   its dimensions are given by content-box width and height.

## Where can we put CSS?

-   There are three places you can declare CSS styling:
    -   External Style Sheet (A separate document)
    -   Internal in the head.
    -   Inline in the actual element tag.
-   In case of Conflicts:
    -   The CSS closest to the element will “win-out” in conflicts.
    -   So inline will override styling in the head which will override styling in an external sheet.

## CSS Properties

-   There are many, many properties that can be styled with CSS. Some include:
-   Border:
    -   Border width
    -   Border style (dashed, dotted, none etc)
    -   Border color
-   Padding:
    -   Padding top/right/bottom/left.
    -   Giving the generic padding with numbers will shorthand the filling out of these options:
        -   1 number
            -   all four sides
            -   {padding:70px;}
            -   makes a nice square
        -   2 numbers
            -   first number is the top and bottom, the second is right and left.
            -   {padding:35px 70px;}
        -   3 numbers
            -   first number is the top, second is left and right, 3rd is the bottom
            -   {padding: 25px 45px 70px;}
        -   4 numbers
            -   first number is the top, 2nd is right, 3rd is bottom, 4th is left.
            -   {padding: 25px 45px 70px 80px;}
-   Margin
    -   similar to padding just on the other side of the border.
-   Display
    -   determine whether it’s an Inline or Block element. The display behavior.
-   Position
    -   defines where on the page the element is displayed.
-   Static
    -   the element box is arranged normally. (Default)
-   Relative
    -   defaults to the normal position but can change in relation to other elements.
-   Absolute
    -   element’s box is placed in an absolute location on the page. (top-right for example)
-   Fixed
    -   the element’s box is in a fixed location in the window, unaffected by user scrolling.
-   Color
    -   allows you to change the color.
    -   Color options including simple color names (red), rgb, hexadecimal, or hsl.
-   Text Align
    -   sets the text inside the content to be of a particular alignment.
    -   i.e. left right justified or centered.

## CSS Selectors:

-   _Element Selectors_
    -   Selects all the instances of an html element such as a paragraph.

```css
p {
	text-align: center;
	color: blue;
}
```

-   _ID Selector_
    -   Selects by the ID attribute of the element.
    -   IDs should be unique.
    -   Uses the # to select.

```css
#div1 {
	text-align: center;
	color: blue;
}
```

-   _Class Selectors_
    -   will style any element with the declared class attribute.
    -   Uses the . to select.
    -   Can be combined with element selectors.

```css
.intro {
	text-align: center;
	color: blue;
}
```

```css
p.intro {
	text-align: center;
	color: red;
}
```

-   _Universal selector_ -
    -   selects everything.
    -   Uses the \*

```css
* {
	text-align: center;
	color: pink;
}
```

-   _Attribute Selector_
    -   Allows you to select elements that declare a specific attribute.
    -   Uses the [] to select.

```css
[title] {
	text-align: left;
	color: blue;
}

[class="”warning”"] {
	color: green;
}
```

-   **Grouping Selectors**
    -   you can group multiple selectors and apply the same style.
    -   Simply declare the selectors and separate them with a comma

```css
H1,
#para1 {
	text-align: left;
	color: red;
}
```

-   _Child selectors_
    -   Selects specific elements that are direct children of another specific type of element.
    -   Uses the > sign.

```css
div > p {
	text-align: left;
	color: red;
}
```

-   _Descendents selectors_ -
    -   like a child selector but will affect every element under the “parent” element no matter how far down it is nested.
    -   It uses an empty space character “ “ between the parent and the decedent.

```css
Div p {
	text-align: left;
	color: red;
}
```

-   _Sibling Selectors_
    -   selects an element that is a direct sibling to another element.
    -   Uses the ~ to select.

```css
Div ~ p {
	text-align: left;
	color: red;
}
```

-   Parents and siblings??

-   \<div id=”mydiv”>
-   \<p> This is a direct child of mydiv</p>
-   \<div>
-   \<p>this is a descendant of mydiv but not a direct child</p>
-   \</div>
-   \</div>
-   \<p> This is adjacent sibling of mydiv</p>

-   Conflicts -

    -   If selectors conflict with each other then the “winning” CSS is determined by specificity:
        -   ID wins over everything.
        -   Class beats anything beside ID.
        -   Element is the lowest priority.
        -   If specificity does not resolve the conflict the determination is made by the order of the declarations. The last declaration declared will win.

# CSS3

-   CSS3 is the newest version of CSS and implements new features to help with making adaptive web pages for mobile devices.
-   Particularly responsive web design (read below).

## Bootstrap 4

-   Why write your own CSS when you can _steal_ someone else’s?
    -   Bootstrap basically lets you do this.
    -   It is an open source framework with a “mobile first” design approach.
-   It uses HTML 5 and CSS3 to give **predesigned styling** to webpages.
-   This styling is capable of being resized and displayed on most any sized screen.
-   Bootstrap can be added to your webpage in two main ways.
    -   You can download it directly from getbootstrap.com
    -   You can simply use a link tag to the bootstrap CDN in your header.
-   Bootstrap uses predefined classes for you to use it with styling elements.

### Bootstrap Grid System

-   Bootstrap uses a layout called the grid system.
    -   It consists of containers which contain rows, which themselves contain columns.
    -   This layout will be responsive to window size changes. (If it is used correctly.)
-   This is how we achieve **responsive web design**
-   **Containers**
    -   are the basic layout element used to wrap the content of a web page.
    -   There are two container classes:
        -   **container**
            -   responsive fixed width container
        -   **Container-fluid**
            -   full width container that spans the entire viewport.
-   **Rows**
    -   are horizontal slices of a container.
    -   They are created with the “row” class.
    -   Rows have a base size of 12.
-   **Columns** -
    -   columns have a dynamic width determined by their size relative to the size of the row in the container’s view.
    -   Columns can be assigned a size.
    -   **If** the size of the columns exceeds 12,
        -   the column exceeding the size will be moved below the columns that do not.
    -   class=”col-sm-3”
        -   col is for column,
        -   the small represents the default size of the column
        -   the “3” is the relative size compared to the row’s size 12.

### Bootstrap Styled Elements

-   Bootstrap has many many classes to style all sorts of HTML elements.
-   Bootstrap Tables are predefined styling for tables that can be declared again by class.
    -   class=”table table-dark”
        -   creates a table with a dark background
    -   table-bordered =
        -   adds border on all sides of the table.
    -   table-striped =
        -   adds zebra striping to the table.
-   Bootstrap forms use the “form-control” class.
    -   You can then use the “col” classes like you would in a row to outline the shape of the form.
-   Bootstrap has a bunch of button classes that let you color your buttons. Eg btn-danger will give you a red button.
-   Bootstrap has a navbar class with associated classes for styling a navbar.
