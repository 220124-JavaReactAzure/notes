# Introduction to the Web

-   Basically a system of internet servers that support specially formated documents
    -   Client/User requests for some resources
    -   Requests are sent to the web server
    -   Web server repsonds to the request and sends information back to the client/user
-   **HTTP**
    -   HyperText Transfer Protocol
        -   clients and servers use this on the web to communicate

# Web Services

-   A software system designed to support interoperablity of machine-to-machine interaction over a network
    -   _English pleasE?!?!_
        -   machines talking to one another
        -   More specific:
            -   a collection of **open protocols** and **standards** used to exchange the data between applications or systems
            -   This Connection:
                -   Software applications that are written in various programming languages (polyglot)
                -   Allow for these programs to be running on various platforms
                    -   AWS, GCP, Azure, localhosts, various websites that host
-   Their **interoperability**
    -   comminication between diffferent programming languages
        -   Java & Python
        -   Windows & Linux
        -   due to those **open standards**
-   Web Services have two primary types of Architecture layout
    -   SOAP
        -   you've heard, cool.
    -   REST
        -   REpresentation State Transfer
        -   THIS IS OUR FOCUS
        -   it's an architecture, more of a guideline

# Client-Server Architecture

-   a networking model in which the server provides services to clients to perform user-based tasks
-   A client and a server are two peices of software that might be on the same computer or two different computers that might be separated by miles or even continents over the inter
-   **Server**
    -   software that's designed to process a request
    -   deliver a reponse over the internet
-   **Client**
    -   the ones making the request of the server
-   **Protocol**
    -   establishing a connection between the clients with a set of rules
-   **HTTP Proctocol**
    -   there are a few others
    -   HTTP is the most popular
    -   Once the connection is establish
        -   Client **sends an HTTP Requests** to the server in the form of XML or JSON (note: JSON accounts for about 99.9% of all requests now)
        -   After parsing this request, your server will respond with the appropraite data. **HTTP Response**

## Requests & Responses

-   _Requests_
-   are made by client/users
    -   Body
    -   Method/Verb
        -   GET PUT POST PATCH DELETE
    -   URL
    -   HTTP Version
    -   Headers
        -   meta-deta to provide infromation about the request
-   _Responses_
    -   Are made by the server/database
        -   Body
        -   Headers
        -   status codes

### Type of Client-Server Archtiecture

-   _2-tier Architecture_
-   _3-Tier architecture_
    -   _Presentation/Interface layer_
        -   the front end layer and consists of the user interface
    -   _Service layer_
        -   contains the functional business logic, which drives an applications core capabilities
    -   _Data Layer_
        -   consists of a database system and data access layer.
-   _n-tier archtiecture_
    -   There are multiple business logic & data logic layers
    -   it increase the flexibility and reusability of applications
    -   **_this can be difficult to implement_**

## URI

-   **Uniform Resource Indentifier**
    -   SUPERSET of URL
    -   Main aim is to find a resource and differentiate from other resources on your server
        -   Imagine a filepath
        -   https://monsterLab.com/scientists/cjester (cjester is a parameter in the path)
        -   https://monsterLab.com/scientists?username=cjester (cjester ia a query param in the path)

## URL

-**Uniform Resource Locator**

-   Subset of URI
-   Main aim is to get the location or address of a resource
-   URL is used to locate only webpages
-   ALL URLs can be URIs

## Verbs/Methods

-   **GET**
    -   this is simply to request information
    -   genreally speaking, it has an empty body
    -   Data is sent in the header or in url
    -   _NOT_ secured
    -   analogous to select statements in sql
-   **POST**
    -   This is used to create a new object/add completey new data entry into your database
    -   You **NEED** to provide information in the body
        -   Scientist firstname, lastname, username, email, password
    -   is secured
    -   large amounts of data can be sent
    -   Analogous to insert statements in sql
-   **PUT**
    -   Used to update **a complete resource**
    -   Information needs to be in the body
        -   contains whole class/object/model
    -   Analogous to updates in SQL
    -   Used more often the patch
-   **PATCH**
    -   used to update **a specific part of the resource**
    -   Information needs to be int he body
        -   single+ field (not all components of a model/object)
        -   **_MAKE SURE_** your identifier is checked and validate
-   **DELETE**
    -   removes the resource
    -   **use with caution\*** as with every delete

### Safe vs Idempotent Verbs

-   Safe
    -   it should NEVER EVER EVER make any changes to the server
        -   GET
        -   should be able to run these verbs 1000000000000x and it does nothing to your server
-   Idempotent
    -   same requests will result in the same state of the server/database if you send multiple times
    -   NO MATTER how manyu requests you send, the server will remain the same
    -   DELETE, PUT, PATCH

## What on earth is being passed around in these bodys? from requests and responses

-   **JSON**
    -   JavaScript Object Notation
    -   This is used for every language
        -   JS is on EVERY web page
    -   **Key-value pairs** for objects in JS
        -   not specific for JS
        -   **Language Agnostic**
    -   At it's core
        -   just text but it's formatted in a way that allows computer programs to easily parse
        -   USED ALL THE TIME

```json
{
	"scientistId": 13,
	"firstName": "Charles:",
	"lastName": "Jester",
	"username": "cjester",
	"email": "cjester@mail.com",
	"password": "superSecure",
	"isTrainer": true
}
```

-   CANNOT return from JSON
    -   functions
    -   undefined
-   JS has built-in parsers for JSON to make web vcommunicaton easy
-   Java doesn't, so we need to important some libraries to handle it
-   **Jackson** parsing from JSON to Object and vice versa

# REST

-   Stands for **REpresentaional State Transfer**
-   It's an architectural style/convetion for web services that presents a server as a collection of resources
    -   Accessed via specific endpoints
    -   **_IT'S AN ARCHTETCTURAL STYLE_**
        -   even though it lays our guidelines, WE CHOOSE what it follows
        -   **Endpoints** are determined by the URI
-   Int a nutshell, \*REST outlines how a client and server communicate\*\*
    -   Roy Fielding, in 2000 REST was his dissertation
    -   **claims** it's not limited to HTTP as it's protocol.....
    -   but lets be honest it's most widely used for HTTP

## 6 Guiding Principles of a RESTful API

-   **Client-server Architecture**
    -   separating user interface (front end) from our data storage/databased
    -   allows for portability across multiple platforms and abstraction in general
-   **Layered Architecture**
    -   server should be designed in a layered fashion so that client is not awway of how the server is designed beyond that of the interacrtion layer
-   **Stateless**
    -   Each request from a client to the server must contain all information necessary for the server to understand the complete request
    -   Server doesn't store any context information abou the client (sessions)
-   **Cacheable**
    -   Our responses should be saved by the client
    -   Because our response are resoureces at particular endpoints you should be able to _cache_ these resources to prevent repeated requests
-   **Uniform Interface**
    -   System architecture that should be designed in away that makes finding resources highly logical
    -   URIS should process from the general to the collection of specific resources
        -   www.mycars.com/cars
            -   Return All cars
        -   www.mycars.com/cars/sportscar
            -   Return all cars that are type sportscar from the database
        -   www.mycars.com/car/sportscar/bugatti-model12
            -   return specifically the bugatti-model12 from the database
-   **(Optional because no best practice) Code on Demond**
    -   Allows client functionality to be expanded by downloading and executing code
        -   in the form of applets or scripts to use with resources
    -   it's not particularly well defined or agreed upon within the software development community at large

## Status Codes

-   100's
    -   informational
-   200's
    -   Success!
    -   201 successfully created
-   300's
    -   Redirect
-   400's
    -   Client Error
    -   404 Not Found
        -   say you provide an ID 203, but the highest ID is 200
    -   403 Forbidden
        -   meaning this users don't have the require permission
    -   418 I'm a teapot
    -   451 unavailable due to government censorship
-   500's
    -   Server errors
