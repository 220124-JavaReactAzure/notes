# Git

## Time to Git Gud @ Git

-   A DevOps tool used for source code management
-   It is a free, open-source version control system
-   used to handle small to very large project
-   Tracking Changes of source code
    -   enabling multiple developers to work together in non-linear development
-   _Key Features_
    -   Tracks history
    -   Free and open-source
    -   Supports non-linear development
    -   Creates backups
    -   Scalable
    -   Supports collaboration
    -   Distributed development

## Git Workflow

-   Divided into three states
    -   **Working Directory**
        -   Modify file sin your working directory
    -   **Staging Area (index)**
        -   Stage the files and add snapshots of them to your staging area
    -   **Git Directory (Repository)**
        -   Perform a commit that stores the snapshots permanently to your git directory
        -   Chekcout any ecisting version, make changes, stage and commit!

## Branching

-   Branching in git ise used to keep your changes until they are ready
-   You can do your own work on a branch while the main branch remains stable
-   After you're done with your work you can merge it with the main branch
    -   Allows you to work on small or large feature updates on the source code and implement them moving forward

## Command Git Commands

-   **_Creating/Connecting to a Repository from CLI_**

```bash
# This will generate an empty git repository using the main branch as the origin
git init -b main

# Git remote to connect a local repo to a remote repo. Can have a name set to avoid having to remember the URL of the repo
git remote add origin https://github.com/220124-JavaReactAzure/CourseRepo.git
```

-   **_Make Changes_**

```bash
# This adds all files that have been modified on your current branch to the staging area. **Required** in order to commit too a respository
git add .


# Record the change smade in the files to a local repository
# Best Practice: Always include a message with each commit explaining the changes
git commit -m "This is a generic commit message"

## Return the current state of the repository for the current working branch. Will show any files in the staging area
git status

# This has a lot of various application. Learn more in the official documentation.
# Two Important settings are user.name and user.email. These values set what email address and name commits will be from a local computer
git config --global user.name "JesterCharles"
```

-   [Official Documentation - git config](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-config)
-   **_Parallel Development_**

```bash
# This determines what branch the local repo is on, you can add a new branch or delete a branch as well
git branch jester_branch
git branch -a
git branch -d jester_branch

# start working in a different branch requires the checkout to switch between branches
git checkout branch_name
git checkout -b new_branch

# Inegreate branches together with git merge to combines the changes from one branch to another branch. More commonly handled on the website than in CLI
# Merges changes into the current branch
git merge branch_name


```

-   **_Sync Repos_**

```bash
# Create a local working copy of an existing remote repo using git clone
git clone https://github.com/220124-JavaReactAzure/CourseRepo.git

# Get the lastest version of a repo. Pulls changes from the remote repo to local repo
git pull origin jester_branch

# Send local commits to the remote repo. REQUIRES two parameters the remote repository and the branch that the push is for.
git push origin jester_branch

# Not ready to push for a commit on yor changes. Then use this to store work and give a clean working directory.
# I.E When working on a new feature but an urgent bug requires your attention
git stash -u # stores work with untracked files
git stash pop # brings back the stashed work to the working directory

```
