        -   PEAK LOAD provisioning: procure some infrastructure prior to a peak load
        -   can over provision infratstructure leading to more cost
        -   Data Center constraints maintenance team isn't large
            -   incurring cost for employing on-premise security, cyber security and IT etc
        -   Might need even more to backup
        -   Procuring those resources might cost you an arm and leg

# Regions and Zones

-   Multiple data centers helps solve if one data center crashs
-   Multiplke reaggions and data centers around the world provide:
    -   faster access (most of the time)
    -   solves issues with the crashs/natural disasters affecting Data Centers
-   Regions
    -   US-Central, US-Easts
-   Zones
    -   contained within these regions (generally speaking there is always at least 3 zones)
-   Availability Zones
    -   Multiple zones (at least 3)
    -   _Fault tolerant_
        -   failure of the data center won't affect you system
