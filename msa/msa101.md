# MSA

## What is it? What was before it?

-   Monolith
    -   One large application
    -   if you want to duplicate services for higher demand, it requires you to re-create the entire application, even if you only require log in
    -   One language
    -   1000000000000000 (hyperbole, many lines long)
-   MSA - Microservice Architecture
    -   services are broken into tinier applications
    -   they communicate via HTTP Req/Resp sending back-and-forth JSONs
    -   They are language agnostic (asked on QC)
    -   Polyglot (multiple languages used to write each service)
    -   scales horizontally
        -   meaning you can create new instances of each service with out adding the others
    -   High maintainability and testablity
    -   Loosely coupled application
    -   Independency deployability
    -   You can break into smaller teams
    -   Downsides:
        -   MSA can be expensive, maybe think about limitations
        -   Service Discovery:
            -   This is about the different services that interact with one another, finding one another
            -   If they scale up in amount, those new services have new urls
                -   Ways to handle:
                    -   Kubernetes (container orchestration) - service discovery and then some
                    -   Netflix Eureka (Spring)
                    -   Consul - HashiCorp (they also make Terraform with is Infrastructure as Code)
                    -   Other 3rd party applications
