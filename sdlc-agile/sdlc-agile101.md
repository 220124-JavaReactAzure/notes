# SDLC & Agile

## SDLC (Software Development Life Cyclce)

-   Refers to a methodology with clearly defined processes
-   Primary goal is to create high-quality software and lowest cost in the shortest possible time
-   Provides a wel l-structured flow of phases the hlep an organization to quickly produce a goal
-   Along with making sure it's well testedd and ready for production
-   Focuses on the following phases of software development
    -   Requirement Analysis
    -   Planning
    -   Software Design such as architectural design (skeletons)
    -   Software Development
    -   Testing
    -   Deployment

### How it works

-   Lowering the cost of software development while simultaneiously improving quality and shorting production time
-   Achevies this by following a plan the removes the typical pitsfalls of software development and project
    -   Two general scenarios
        -   **Building a completely new system/appplication/API**
        -   **Working on an existing system**
    -   Ask for end-user or client feedback

### Waterfall

-   Old school approach
-   Not inherently bad
-   Far more restrictice and based procedure

### Agile

-   Mindset/Philosophy
-   There are NO specific rules
-   Core belive is that you should be adaptable
    -   being _agile_ in your approach to probelms
    -   being quick to come up with solutions
-   **4 main Tenets about Agile**
    -   **Adapt to change OVER following a plan**
    -   **Customer Collaboration OVER contracts**
    -   **Communication OVER Procedure**
    -   **Demos OVER Documentation**

#### Agile-Scrum

-   Implementation of the Agile Philosophy
-   Based on interative _sprints_
    -   typically 2weeks - month
-   Key Roles
-   **Products owner**
    -   Person Ultimately incharge of the success of a project
-   **Scrum Master**
    -   Leads the scrum team (King of the Scrumlings) and their job is to achieve peak efficiency
-   **Team Memebers (scrumlings)**
    -   these are the developers in a scrum team working on the project
-   Key Ceremonies
    -   **Storyboard grooming/Sprint Planning**
        -   Creating user stores and assigning them
    -   **Daily Standup**
        -   Daily meeting to disccus what you're working on
    -   **Sprint Review**
        -   Gather all your demos and all artifacts together
    -   **Sprint Retrospective**
        -   Go over how the sprint went
        -   Lessons learned
        -   What to do the next sprint
    -   _Backlog Refinement_
        -   fixing issues
        -   make any suggested changes

## User Story

-   In most agile approaches (scrum) you approach building software from the perspective of User Stories
-   Planning a feature from the perspective of the end user
    -   **AS A** employee **I WANT TO** view pending order **SO THAT** I can follow up with the client
    -   **Feature Sprawl**
        -   writing code for a feature that no one really requested
    -   Generally a combintaong of a :
        -   Type of user
        -   What the user wants to do
        -   Why they want tot od it

| As a     | I want to           | So that                                           |
| -------- | ------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| Employee | View pending orders | I can start on th order as soon as they come in   |
| Customer | Save my order       | I can quickly re-order my favorites in the future |

-   **Pointing**
    -   Assigned a difficulty level to the task/completion of a user story
    -   Commonly: 1,2,3,4,5
    -   Alternative difficulty metrics
        -   xs,s,m,l,xl
        -   1,2,3,5,8,13
    -   If you have an user story that is above 5, xl, 13, it can probably be broken down

## Agile-Kanban

-   popular framework used to implement agile and devops
-   requires real-time communication of capactiy and full transparency of work
-   Gives teams:
    -   more flexible planning option
    -   faster output
    -   clearer focus
-   All you need for the implementation of this is a board of cards
-   Kanban is translanted from Japanese into "visual signal"

## Kanban Boards

-   All kanban teams revolve around this board
-   Helps visualize work and optimization flow amungst the team
-   Virtual boards are crucial feature in any agile software development
    -   traceability
    -   easier to collaborate
    -   accessiblity from mutliple locations
-   **Full transparency** of your owrk and **real-time communication**
